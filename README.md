<h1 align="center">ü¶î‚ö° Pokedex </h1>


<b>Pokedex</b> is a small demo application based on Next.js. The pokemons will be fetched from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) using the SWR library. The project introduces you to data fetching on the client-side with the SWR library, Dynamic Routing, and many more advanced Next JS Concepts.

#### üçÄ Motivation

Since I was a little boy üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I've been passionate about Pok√©mon ü¶î. It was always fun playing the games on the Game Boy and conquering all the Leagues. Now as a developer, I want to play around with the [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### ‚úî Features
- Explore pokemons
- Search pokemons by name
- See the abilities and damage level of pokemons in the details page

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### üè´ Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
